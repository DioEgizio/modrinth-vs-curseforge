An explanation as to why Modrinth is a better modding platform than Curseforge is.

# Why Curseforge is a bad platform
If you ever used Curseforge in any capacity in the past year or so. You probably have noticed the horrendous use of advertisements, the UI bugs and many other nonsensical things Curseforge has done. 

Screenshot of the advertisements seen on CF as a normal user.

Not only is there terrible usage of advertisements and UI bugs, there is general inconsistency on CF as shown below

Curseforge's search is very clunky at best and outright broken at worst. If you wanted to search for a Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.18.2, it is impossible to specify "Fabric", "1.18.2", and a category the mod you want might be in. You are stuck having to specify "Fabric" and a category and then scrolling until you find the mod you want. While searching via the search bar works, it takes you to a different page where all you have is a search bar to input what you want in. No categories, no Minecraft versions, no modloader filters, etc.


# Why Modrinth is a good platform
In short; search that actually works, very good UI/UX, great use of an advertisement, has very minimal UI bugs.

The Modrinth UI on the mods page is very consistent compared to Curseforge's mod page UI.

Modrinth's search is far better than the clunky search CF has. You can specify what categories to search in, what Minecraft versions to filter, what modloaders to filter, and use your searchbar input all without leaving the mods page.
