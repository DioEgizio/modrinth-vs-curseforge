An explanation as to why Modrinth is a better modding platform than Curseforge is.

# Why Curseforge is a bad platform
If you ever used Curseforge in any capacity in the past year or so. You probably have noticed the horrendous use of advertisements, the UI bugs and many other nonsensical things Curseforge has done. 

Screenshot of the advertisements seen on CF as a normal user.

Not only is there terrible usage of advertisements and UI bugs, there is general inconsistency on CF as shown below

# Why Modrinth is a good platform
In short; search that actually works, very good UI/UX, great use of an advertisement, has very minimal UI bugs.

The Modrinth UI on the mods page is very consistent compared to Curseforge's mod page UI.
